# zay-es

Zay-ES (pronounced like Doctor Zaius from Planet of the Apes) is a high-performance Java-based 
[Entity-Component-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) that manages
to side-step most/all of the typical disadvantages of an ES architecture without sacrificing ES "purity".

Zay-ES-Net is the add-on extension that provies client/server networking.
