Zay-ES-Net v???
------------------
* Added support for a TransientComponent tagging interface
    that can be used to avoid sending certain component types over the
    wire. (They go over as null.)  Note: the classes themselves still
    need to be registered with the Serializer so that the types can be
    sent.  This is a compromise over a more invasive and ultimately less
    flexible transient design. (For example: this still lets you grab
    entities with a transient component for selection purposes, it just won't
    have a value.)
* Added support for the new WatchedEntity feature of EntityData.  This can
    be a more efficient way of tracking one entity versus constantly polling
    using getComponent().
* Added EntityDataHostedService and EntityDataClientService implementations
    to take advantage of JME 3.1's new service model.
    

Zay-ES-Net v1.1.1
------------------
* Implemented RemoteEntityData's string index.
* Added trace log for cache hits in RemoteEntityData.


Zay-ES-Net r1207
-----------------
* Modified RemoteEntityData.RemoteEntitySet.release() to check
    to see if the connection is still connected before sending
    the release message.
* Fixed a bug where really eager sendUpdate() calls were causing
    thread contention with entity set creation.  This would be
    especially true for large sets and short update cycles.
* Fixed a similar future-bug for resetting the filter, too,
    though that one would be much harder to time just right, ie:
    even more bizarre if seen in the wild.
